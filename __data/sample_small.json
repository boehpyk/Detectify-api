Although the opening weekend of ‘Oblivion‘ didn’t break any records big or small, it’s a more than solid start for a non-franchise, non-sequel, non-reboot. That’s a sad statement on the current state of Hollywood, but that’s another topic for another day.

Still, it’s Cruise’s biggest opening in quite some time and certainly a step up from ‘Jack Reacher’s disappointing domestic run last year. At the end of the day, ‘Oblivion’ cost a lot of money and this weekend was a really good start. We’ll see how the next few weeks treat it. The weekend was also very kind to ‘42,’ which took a small drop from last week for a weekend gross of $18 million and a $54 million total. With a reported budget of only $40 million, this means that ’42′ is well on its way to being a significant (if slightly minor) hit. Most blockbusters would kill for this kind of profit. Meanwhile, ‘The Croods‘ held onto the number three spot for the third weekend in a row, grossing $9.5 million for a $154 million total. Although $200 million is still a long ways off, DreamWorks’ animated caveman movie has proven shockingly resilient over the past month. Unless it’s completely derailed by the arrival of ‘Iron Man 3′ in a few weeks (and everything in the top ten will be derailed when that happens), it may still have a shot. If not, $180 million is probably a sure thing at this point and that’s nothing","hasKeyColumn":true,"keyColumnIndex":1,"headerRowIndex":0}

The household heads living in larger households, having a larger farm size, and working full-time (more hours per week) in permanent jobs are more likely to stay in agricultural employment. The empirical evidence clearly suggests that human capital plays a crucial role for labor mobility and labor adjustment. Young, female and educated individuals are more likely to enter into employment in non-agricultural, particularly service activities. There are remarkable circular flows of elderly and less educated persons between being employed in agriculture, unemployment and retirement pools. Small-scale and part-time farming provide temporary employment opportunities. Investments in human capital to improve quality of labor in agriculture and to increase mobility and flexibility of labor are the key issues in synergy reducing labor mismatch and improving efficiency in labor flow adjustment.","http://purl.umn.edu/25803","International Association of Agricultural Economists\u003e2003 Annual Meeting, August 16-22, 2003, Durban, South Africa","6","English","2003 Annual Meeting, August 16-22, 2003, Durban, South Africa"]],"pageTitle":"AgEcon Search: Item 25803","title":"","url":"http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/25803","hasHeader":true,"headerPosition":"FIRST_ROW","tableType":"ENTITY","tableNum":5,"s3Link":"common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438044271733.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728004431-00342-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz","recordEndOffset":4122114,"recordOffset":4113912,"tableOrientation":"VERTICAL","TableContextTimeStampAfterTable":"{8799\u003dAgEcon Search \u003e        International Association of Agricultural Economists \u003e           2003 Annual Meeting, August 16-22, 2003, Durban, South Africa \u003e}","lastModified":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 18:22:58 GMT","textBeforeTable":"Please use this identifier to cite or link to this item: http://purl.umn.edu/25803 AgEcon Search \u003e        International Association of Agricultural Economists \u003e           2003 Annual Meeting, August 16-22, 2003, Durban, South Africa \u003e --\u003e About DSpace   Edit Profile authorized users My AgEcon Search Receive email updates Sign on to: Current Statistics Statistics 2001-2008 --\u003e Per paper","textAfterTable":"Files in This Item: File Size Format cp03bo04.pdf 229Kb PDF View/Open Recommend this item All items in AgEcon Search are protected by copyright.     Brought to you by the University of Minnesota Department of Applied Economics and the University of Minnesota Libraries with cooperation from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association.
